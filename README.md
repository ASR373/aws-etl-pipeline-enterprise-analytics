# 🧭 AWS ETL Pipeline – Enterprise Analytics

### 🚀 End-to-End Serverless Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a **fully automated, serverless ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipeline** built entirely on **AWS**.  
It ingests raw data into S3, transforms it using **AWS Glue**, orchestrates automation through **Lambda** and **EventBridge**, catalogs processed data with a **Glue Crawler**, and enables analytics directly from **Athena** — all with real-time monitoring and alerts.
